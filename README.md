# BaPOS

New Repo because I trashed the last one.

We want to save here: Edited source files Each setup script that we create. It may be worth keeping a bunch of differetn seperate ones. So one for sorting out the kernel, then one per each tarball we're editing.

Tarballs may be worth: unzipping, copy in edited source file, retar, replace in folder?
